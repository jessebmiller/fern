Personal eternal computing system

# Background

* Setting up a personal computing system (laptop, phone, etc...)
  is generally a one time job and the result is good for about 3
  years or so? Then it's time to reinstall and get a fresh start.
* Crud builds up in our systems with use
* Each device we own is set up ad hock and therefor is another
  pet to take care of
* Removing the crud without just starting from scratch is hard

# Goals

* Separate the device from the system so that the system can
  outlive the device
* Simplify the process of evolving the system. It should be
  simpler to update the system than it is to update the device
* Maintain progress but not cruft according to the owner whose
  mind might change
* Encourage experiments by limiting the scope of their
  concequences
* If the system is personal and eternal, most of the time using it
  will be as an expert. Optimize efficiency for expert (in the
  system) usage.
